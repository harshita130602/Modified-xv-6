# REPORT (2019101126)

## QUESTION 1
If a process voluntarily relinquishes control of the CPU, it leaves the queuing network, and when the process becomes ready again after the I/O, it is inserted at the tail of the same queue, from which it is relinquished earlier. (Explain in the report how could this be exploited by a process ?)

### Explanation : 
If suppose a process with high I/O demand comes , then it’ll be stuck in the higher priority queues for a long amount of time and hence it’ll have an advantage over other processes.

## QUESTION 2 
Include the performance comparison between the default and 3 implemented
scheduling policies in the report.

### Explanation : 
Average total time for each Scheduler using time command :
* FCFS - 4100 ticks
* RR - 3000 ticks
* PBS -  3100 ticks
* MLFQ -  3050 ticks

### Conclusion:
**The total time taken by all the schedulers gives us the following conclusions:**
* FCFS is the slowest as overall turnaround time is increased , which is caused by CPU bound processes executing before I/O bound processes.
* MLFQ and PBS are faster in comparision.
* RR is the fastest, and executes a little faster than MLFQ and PBS as it gives fair run time to all the forked processes.
* RR <= MLFQ <= PBS < FCFS
